            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Orcas, or Killer Whales, are the largest members of the oceanic dolphin family. They are clearly recognizable both in their striking black and white coloration, and in their large size. Orcas can be found in oceans all around the world, only avoiding certain areas of the Artic Ocean.</p>

            <h3>Orca Habits</h3>
            <p>Orcas are extremely social animals. They live in large pods where they hunt and raise their young. As apex predators, Orcas are at the very top of the food chain in the ocean. Their tactical hunting strategies are deadly and effective, and they are known to attack anything from small fish to Great White Sharks and whales. While they are deadly killers, they very rarely attack humans.</p>

            <h3>Conservation</h3>
            <p>Orcas, as oceanic mammals, are protected by the <a href=https://www.fws.gov/international/laws-treaties-agreements/us-conservation-laws/marine-mammal-protection-act.html class="grow">Marine Mammal Portection Act</a>. This means that humans are not an immediate threat to them. Because of insufficent data, conservationists are unable to determine whether or not Orcas should be listed as an endangered species. At this time Orcas are not believed to be endangered, however they, like other marine animals, are effected by climate change and poachers. Conservation is critical in perserving Orcas and other marine species.</p>
